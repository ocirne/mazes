title: Mazes

This ist an implementation of [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/) by Jamis Buck.

The Python Implementation is mostly an 1:1 translation from the original Ruby code.
With Kotlin I did some refactoring and added bonus implementations. 

## [The Basics](the-basics.html)

- Basic Grid
- Rendering: ASCII, Image, Unicode, Coloring
- Maze algorithms: Binary Tree, Sidewinder, Aldous-Broder, Wilson’s, Hunt-and-Kill, Recursive Backtracker
- Path finding algorithm: Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Counting Dead-Ends

## [Next Steps](next-steps.html)

- Masks: ASCII, Image
- Grids: Polar, Hex, Triangle, Upsilon
- Braiding
- Cost-Aware Dikstra’s
- Insets
- Weaving

## [More Algorithms](more-algorithms.html)

- Maze algorithms: Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Growing Tree, Eller’s, Recursive Division

## [Shapes and Surfaces](shapes-and-surfaces.html)

...

## [Boni](boni.md)

- Tests
- Eller's on other Grids
